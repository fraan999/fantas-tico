    </div> <h1> Empire State Of Mind </h1>
        <h2> <em>Jay-Z, Alicia Keys</em></h2>
   <p>Grew up in a town that is famous as a place of movie scenes<br/>
Noise is always loud, there are sirens all around and the streets are mean<br/>
If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere, that's what they say<br/>
Seeing my face in lights or my name in marquees found down on Broadway<br/><br/>
Even if it ain't all it seems, I got a pocketful of dreams<br/>
Baby I'm from <strong>New York</strong><br/>
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of<br/>
There's nothing you can't do<br/>
Now you're in <strong>New York</strong><br/>
These streets will make you feel brand new<br/>
Big lights will inspire you<br/>
Hear it for <strong>New York, New York, New York</strong><br/><br/>
On the avenue, there ain't never a curfew, ladies work so hard<br/>
Such a melting pot, on the corner selling rock, preachers pray to God<br/>
Hail a gypsy cab, takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge<br/>
Someone sleeps tonight with a hunger far more than an empty fridge<br /></p>
